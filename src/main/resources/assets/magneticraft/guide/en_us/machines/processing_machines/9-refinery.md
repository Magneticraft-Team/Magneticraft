# Refinery

This tall tower can separate oil into different fluids based on their density. 

The refinery requires steam to work and the speed depends on the recipe.

In the first level: the fluid input is at the back and the steam input is at the sides. 
The rest of the levels have outputs at every side and the level indicates the type of the output.

This structure is a [multiblock](../../3-multiblocks.md) of size *3, 9, 3* (x, y, z).

Materials needed:
- 1 x Refinery Blueprint
- 32 x Support Column
- 48 x Corrugate Iron Machine Block
