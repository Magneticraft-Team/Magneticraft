# Solar Tower

This multiblock creates steam using the heat provided by [Solar Mirrors](6.1-solar-mirror.md).
The steam can be used for energy in a [Steam engine](2-steam-engine.md).

The structure has 2 connectors, the blue connector is the water input and orange connector the expels steam.

The max production of the tower is 1200 mB of steam per tick, equivalent to 2400 Watts.
Every solar mirror linked to the tower generates 16 Watts in the form of heat.

This structure is a [multiblock](../../6-multiblocks.md) of size *3, 3, 3* (x, y, z).
