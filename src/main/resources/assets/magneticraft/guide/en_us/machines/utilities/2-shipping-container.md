# Shipping Container

This multiblock holds a large amount of items but only of one type. 
It can hold up to 1024 stacks (can be changed in config).

If the container is broken the content will be dropped to the ground, but there is a limit of how many stacks
it can drop, by default is 128 stacks.

This structure is a [multiblock](../../6-multiblocks.md) of size *3, 3, 7* (x, y, z).

Materials needed:
- 1  x Shipping Container Blueprint
- 56 x Corrugated Iron Machine Block
