# Oil heater

This machine allows to heat up fluids to their boiling point. 
The machine doesn't require fuel or electricity, instead it uses external heat sources. The machine accepts heat from the bottom. 

The oil heater is used for oil refining, it will heat up oil until it becomes hot crude, that can be distilled in a [refinery](9-refinery.md). 
The oil heater is slower than the refinery so you will need several heaters to get the maximum speed.

The speed of the machine depends on the recipe, but the energy usage is constant (60Watts by default).

The fluid input is at the back and the fluid output is at the top.
