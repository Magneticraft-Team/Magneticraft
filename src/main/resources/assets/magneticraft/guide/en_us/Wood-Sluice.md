**Wood Sluice**

The second step in the ore duplication process. The Wood Sluice allows you to sift Rocky Clumps in to Clumps using water and a bit of time.

Items are placed into the taller barrel of the Sluice by right-clicking on it with the item you wish to place in it in your hand. You can place up to 12 items in to the Sluice at a time. 

Once the desired number of items have been placed in to the Sluice, you then need to right-click on the taller barrel of the Sluice with a bucket of water.

The sifted versions of the items you put in will be output in to the world at the lower end of the Sluice, where the water runs off.

If you put a Wood Sluice at the low end of another Sluice and down a block. It will be able to use the run off water from the first to sift the items in the second instead of having to use another bucket of water to do so. There is no limit to the number of Sluices the water can pass through and sifted.
