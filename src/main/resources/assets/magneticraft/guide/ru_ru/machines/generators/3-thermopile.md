# Thermopile

This generator produces energy from temperature differences, so to make it work just place a hot block, like lava, 
in one side and a cold block, like snow, in other side.

In the gui you can see 3 bars, the energy bar, the production bar (energy produced) and the flux bar, this last bar shows 
the amount of heat that is moving throw the block, the higher this bar gets the more energy will be produced.

There a lot of blocks that can be used as a heat source, any liquid will work and all the vanilla blocks 
that are hot or cold are registered, even the heat pipes can be used as a heat source.

Every block has a temperature and a thermal resistance, so it's not just placing the hotter and coldest blocks you can find.
Usually things that are less hot/cold have less resistance, so you will have to trie different combination to get the most efficient configuration.
