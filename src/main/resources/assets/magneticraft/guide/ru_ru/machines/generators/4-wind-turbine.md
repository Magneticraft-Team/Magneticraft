# Wind turbine

This block generates energy from the wind.

**Note:** it requires a space of 8x8 in front of the block to place the turbine.

The amount of energy generated depends on the wind speed and this depends on the position and height of the wind turbine.
Any block in front of the turbine will reduce the energy production. 

The optimal configuration is having a clear 8x8x16 (left, up, forward) empty space in front of the turbine.
