# Conveyor belts

Conveyor belts are cool and safe way to transport items in short distances. 

It has an internal inventory that store all the items, this avoids common conveyor belt issues in other mods, 
like magnets picking up all the items, lag caused by the huge amount of items in-world, etc.

This means that conveyor belts do not pick up in-world items automatically, you need an inserter or pipe to place items on it.
You can also right click to place an item in your hand into the belt or grab an item from the belt.

Conveyor belts don't use power and don't drop items into the ground. If at the end of a conveyor belt there is an inventory,
the belt will insert all the item into the inventory automatically.

Right now the mod doesn't implement vertical conveyor belts or step up conveyor belt, you you will need pipes
or other mechanisms to move items up or down.
