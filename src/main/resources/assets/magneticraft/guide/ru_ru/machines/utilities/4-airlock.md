# Airlock

This block creates a force-field strong enough repel large amounts of water.

Every 2 seconds the machine scans a sphere of 10 block radius and removes all the water, every block of water 
removed costs 2 Joules and if the block scanned is in the edge of he sphere,
it will be replaced by a air bubble, every air bubble requires 1 Joule to maintain, so if the block gets out 
of energy all the bubbles will be removed.

*NOTE:* You can walk through the air bubbles.
