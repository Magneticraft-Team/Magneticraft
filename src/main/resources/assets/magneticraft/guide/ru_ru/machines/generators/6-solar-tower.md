# Solar Tower

This multiblock collects heat from [Solar Mirrors](6.1-solar-mirror.md).
The heat can be used to power machines that use heat or to get electricity using boilers and a [Steam engine](2-steam-engine.md).

The structure has 1 connector at the bottom, you can use heat pipes to transfer the heat to a more convenient location.

Every solar mirror linked to the tower generates 16 Watts in the form of heat. 
If the tower gets too hot it will melt (by default 4000C)

This structure is a [multiblock](../../3-multiblocks.md) of size *3, 3, 3* (x, y, z).

Materials needed:
- 1 x Solar Tower Blueprint
