# Combustion Chamber

This block burns coal or charcoal to generate heat,
the heat can be used to generate steam in a [Steam Boiler](2.2-steam-boiler.md) or in any other machine that needs [heat](../../7-heat.md) to work.

Every tick the combustion chamber will produce 40 Watts of energy in heat. 
The coal/charcoal will last 400 ticks (20 seconds).

When the door of the combustion chamber is open the speed is reduced to half.
