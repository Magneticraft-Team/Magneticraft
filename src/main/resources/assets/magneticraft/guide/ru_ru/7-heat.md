# Heat system

Heat is an important mechanic of the mod, It tries to imitate the real world as much as possible.

The heat flow is measured in watts, the same as electricity and is stored as the internal energy of 
the materials. Every heat conductor has the following properties: internal energy, mass, conductivity and molar mass.
You may noticed that there is no temperature, that is because it's calculated using the internal energy, 
the mass and the molar mass. 

### The no so realistic parts
To make the heat system more simple, there is no energy loss caused by irradiation and all the conductors 
have the same material (Iron) so all them have the molar mass of 55.845 and the total mass of 1Kg per block.
