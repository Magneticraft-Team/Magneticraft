# FORTH

Red power 2 had a computer, the first being a real cpu in minecraft,
the computers in this mod work the same way (they have a different architecture) 
so to make the computer work you need an operative system, 
one of the most basic OS out there is FORTH,
since RP2 already had an implementation of FORTH there are some tutorials online about it.

FORTH is a stack based programing language that can act as operating system because 
has some low level features like direct disk access, pointers, own memory management, and can work in kernel space.

To run commands just type it name, they must be separated with spaces, for example:
2 5 + .
This will print the result of 2 + 5

To get a list of available commands type: WORDS
