# Magneticraft
Magneticraft mod, more info in curseforge https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/magneticraft

***The mod is no longer in development***

Check out this cool [fork](https://github.com/Silfryi/Magneticraft) called [Magnetic Engineering](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/magnetic-engineering):
It turns Magneticraft into an Immersive Engineering + Addons companion/addon by removing most overlapping content.

### Compiling the mod
