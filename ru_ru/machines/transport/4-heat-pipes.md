# Heat pipe

Can move heat, there are 2 variants: the normal will burn you if it's hot and you touch it, the insulated will not.
There is no limit in the amount of heat that the pipe can move, but the speed depends on the distance between
the heat source an the end of the pipe. The pipe doesn't have energy losses.
