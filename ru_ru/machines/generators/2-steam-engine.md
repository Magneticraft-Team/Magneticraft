One of the first ways to generate electricity in Magneticraft.
Uses steam to generate electricity, it produces 2 Watts per milibucket of steam and it has a max energy production of 160 Watts.

To generate the steam you will need a [Combustion Chamber](2.1-combustion-chamber.md) and a [Steam Boiler](2.2-steam-boiler.md).

This structure is a [multiblock](../../3-multiblocks.md) of size *3, 4, 4* (x, y, z).

*NOTE*: it has blocks 1 level below the base block
