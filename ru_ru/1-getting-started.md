# Welcome to Magneticraft

**Disclaimer**

A lot of stuff is not finished or needs more work, 
the mod was tested and should be stable but some features, for example, images in the guide book are not done yet.

### First steps

Magneticraft add 3 types of ores: Copper (Chalcopyrite), Lead (Galena) and Tungsten (Wolframite), 
you can just smelt them in a vanilla furnace,
but the mod adds an early game ore processing. With a [Crushing Table](machines/processing_machines/1-crushing-table.md) you can break 
up the ores into rocky chunks and with a [Sluice Box](machines/processing_machines/2-sluice-box.md) you can filter those rocky chunks to 
get clean chunks to smelt, the Sluice Box will also drop extra dusts from the chunks.

A lot of crafting recipes in the mod require plates, to get them you can place an ingot in a
Crushing Table and smash it with a hammer.
 
After getting the [Crushing Table](machines/processing_machines/1-crushing-table.md) and the [Sluice Box](machines/processing_machines/2-sluice-box.md) the next 
step is to get some energy generation, take a look at the [energy generation section](machines/1-generators.md), 
you may also want to read a bit on how the [electric system](6-electricity.md) works.
